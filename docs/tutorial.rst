This is a tutorial.

Hello World!
~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block::

  print the following
  sanity test "Hello World!"
  thank you very much

This is a "hello world" program, and essentially, as long as the first line contains "print", it knows the rest of this haiku will be a print command. Then, on the next line, it only finds the stuff in quotes, so it doesn't matter what you put around it, as long as it all adds up to 7 syllables. Finally, the "thank you very much" just marks the end of a two-line command.
